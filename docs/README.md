## Introduction

Our aim is to create a general 3d skeleton for a target object through a process which uses a model that understands  the unique and real features of the target object using XAI

## Image Classification Model
As the image classification model we're using MobileNet Image Classification With TensorFlow's Keras API.
MobileNet is a deep learning model architecture designed for efficient image classification on mobile and embedded devices. It was developed by Google and is widely used due to its small size and fast inference speed.

The MobileNet architecture employs depthwise separable convolutions, which significantly reduces the number of parameters and computations required compared to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This reduction allows MobileNet to achieve a good balance between accuracy and model size.
